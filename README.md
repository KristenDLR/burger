# Yum Yum Burger

Add Burgers to the list and press the Devour button to eat them up. This app uses Sequelize queries. Burger's are devoured by carrying a default value of false.
Yum Yum Burger is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers you would like to eat.

## Installation
```bash
Sequelize init to create the necessary files.
```
Run npm init. When that's finished, install and save these npm packages:
```bash
express
express-handlebars
mongoose
cheerio
axios
```


## Description

Whenever a user submits a burger's name, your app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.
Each burger in the waiting area also has a Devour it! button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.
Your app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not
